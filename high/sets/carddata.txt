Autonome	German	Autonome,Puppet	X	Puppet	Organization	Liberal, Fanatic		3	4	1	The Autonome are anarchists. Most are actually peaceful, but the violent ones get the news coverage.	Gives +10 on any attempt to destroy any Government group.
Burschenschaften	German	Burschenschaften,Puppet	X	Puppet	Organization	Conservative		3	5	1	These are conservative, all-male student groups which affect military dress.	You may spend this group's action to draw another Group card at any time. The Burschenschaften count as two conservative groups towards any goal.
CONspiracy	German	CONspiracy,Puppet	X	Puppet	Organization	Weird, Fanatic		2/2	3	1	The German INWO/Magic convention, which hosts the German national M:TG championship.	Gives +1 Power to all your other Weird groups.
Dagobert	German	Dagobert,Puppet	X	Puppet	Personality	Straight, Criminal, Fanatic		1	3	1	A famous German criminal, who specialized in bomb-threat extortion schemes. He's now in jail. (In German, "Uncle Scrooge" is called Dagobert Duck.)	Once per turn, Dagobert can try, as a free action, to steal one Action token from any Corporate group. Roll a die. 1-3 means bad luck; nothing happens. 4-6 means success. Dagobert gets the stolen token, but can only use it for his own defense. Dagobert may only steal tokens before they are used . . . he may not wait until the token is used and try to steal it them!
Der grosse Magier	German	Der_grosse_Magier,Puppet	X	Puppet	Personality	Peaceful	Magic	1/1	2	1	The Great Magician - a stage magician.	Gives +2 on any attempt to control any Magic group. Has +10 for direct control of any Magic group.
Erich Honecker	German	Erich_Honecker,Puppet	X	Puppet	Personality	Conservative, Government	Communist	1	6	1	Honecker was the last leader of East Germany, before reunification. His card replaces Fidel Castro in the German set, but his ability is different.	You may place up to three Plots under Erich. They don't count against your limit, and cannot be exposed. You can use any of them at any time. Before using one, you must remove it from under Erich and roll a die. On a 1 or 3, discard it! On a 4 through 6, use it, paying the normal actions or other costs.
Fussballprofis	German	Fussballprofis,Puppet	X	Puppet	Organization	Corporate	Media	2	4	2	Pro Soccer Players. This group replaces Professional Sports, but with different abilities. Soccer is the leading sport in Germany, and the German national team is one of the best in the world.	The Fussballprofis' Corporate puppets add the attribute Media.
Genschman	German	Genschman,Puppet	X	Puppet	Personality	Liberal (Sometimes), Straight		3/3	3	1	Hans-Dietrich Genscher, former Foreign Minister of Germany, who still has considerable influence throughout Europe.	Genschman is liberal when he feels like it. He is treated as Liberal if and only if you, the Illuminati pulling his strings, want him to be Liberal. He gets a +2 bonus any time he aids in the defense of any Nation.
Hannelore Kohl	German	Hannelore_Kohl,Puppet	X	Puppet	Personality	Conservative, Straight		2	2	1	The wife of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Very active in the campaign against cancer.	The Red Cross gets an extra Action token every turn if Hannelore is in the same Power Structure.
Helmut Kohl	German	Helmut_Kohl,Puppet	X	Puppet	Personality	Conservative, Government, Straight (Sometimes)		4	2	2	Chancellor of Germany since 1982, and leader of the Christdemokraten. Cartoonists love to caricature him with a pear-shaped head.	Helmut gives a +3 on any attempt to control any Government group that is part of Germany. He has a +8 for direct control of any Government group. Any time Helmut's alignment matters, roll a die. On a 1-3, he's Straight at the moment. On a 4-6, he's not.
Hipos	German	Hipos,Puppet	X	Puppet	Organization	Government, Straight		1	4	0	Parking-meter readers - not police, but a volunteer auxiliary. They are not beloved . . .	Spend this group's action to choose one player. Your victim must remove one Action token from each of his groups that has more than one.
Joschka Fischer	German	Joschka_Fischer,Puppet	X	Puppet	Personality	Liberal, Government	Green	1/1	4	2	Leader of the German Green party, anti-nuclear activist, never seen without tennis shoes.	Has a +4 for direct control of any Green group. By using his action, Joschka can cancel an action of the Nuclear Power Companies.
Karnevalisten	German	Karnevalisten,Puppet	X	Puppet	Organization	Straight (Sometimes), Weird (Sometimes)		2	4	2	Carnival-goers. Think of Mardi Gras . . . Every February, a lot of seemingly-normal Germans get very weird, and keep it up until the beer is gone.	Gives +2 on any attempt to control any Weird group. During other players' turn, the Karnevalisten are Straight. During your own turn, they are Weird. (In a two-player game, they're Weird only on every second turn.)
Manta-Fahrer	German	Manta-Fahrer,Puppet	X	Puppet	Organization	Fanatic		1	4	1	Manta drivers - a Manta is a sports car. The Germans tell "Manta driver" jokes as well as blonde jokes. Destroying the Manta drivers will always draw cheers in a German game. The traditional Manta driver dates a hairdresser - thus the scissors.	They're so stupid, they believe everything in the commercials! By spending one Illuminati action, or action(s) of Media groups with total power of 6 or more, you may add any one alignment to the Manta-Fahrer. This effect lasts until the beginning of your next turn. You can't add an alignment that is opposite to one they already have.
Showmaster	German	Showmaster,Puppet	X	Puppet	Personality	Conservative, Straight		1	1	1	A talk show host (replaces Gordo Remora, with different abilities)	Going on his show is always a gamble . . .  Spend his Action token to roll one die for any other Personality, with the consent of that Personality's owner. On a 1-3, the Personality's printed power is reduced permanently to 1. On a 4-6, it is permanently doubled. Only one appearance is allowed for each Personality.
Stammtischpolitiker	German	Stammtischpolitiker,Puppet	X	Puppet	Organization	Straight		1	1	1	Political discussion (and drinking) clubs, mainly of old men.	Constant discussion leads to illumination and the truth... The Stammtischpolitiker can use their action to reverse any alignment of any group in play. This effect lasts until your next turn.
Supertrainer	German	Supertrainer,Puppet	X	Puppet	Personality	Conservative, Straight		2/1	4	2	The Soccer Coach from Hell. In Germany, a good coach sits at the right hand of God . . .	By using his action, the Supertrainer can put a just-played World Cup Victory into your hand. He can do that only once per turn. He has +10 for direct control of the Fussballprofis.
Talkmaster	German	Talkmaster,Puppet	X	Puppet	Personality	Liberal	Media	1	2	1	Another talk show host; in Germany, a "talkmaster" hosts a more serious program, while a "showmaster" is small talk and media flash.	I'm a very good cook. And a very good butler too . . .  He gets +6 for direct control of any Personality.
Tennis-Star	German	Tennis-Star,Puppet	X	Puppet	Personality	Liberal, Straight		1	4	1	Female tennis star.	Your Power Structure gets a +4 to defend against any attack involving a Media group. She gets a +10 against any attack involving a Media group.
Topmodell	German	Topmodell,Puppet	X	Puppet	Personality	Peaceful	Media	1	1	1	Supermodel.	Gives +6 on any attempt to control any male Media Personality. By using her action, she can cancel any action of any Media group.
USA	German	USA,Puppet	X	Puppet	Place	Liberal, Government	Coastal, Huge, Nation	6/5	8	3	In English-language tournaments: Not legal, because - according to local Illuminated propaganda - nobody can ever control the whole US at once, even its own government. From across the Atlantic it looks different . . .	Gives +10 for direct control of the United Nation. Gives +4 on any attempt to destroy Violent groups.
Zuvieldienstleistende	German	Zuvieldienstleistende,Puppet	X	Puppet	Organization	Liberal, Fanatic	Green	2	3	0	The "Zivieldienstleistende" are those who have chosen alternative service (in hospitals or social work) rather than be drafted into the military. Changing the first two letters to "Zu" rather than "Zi" is a German pun implying that they over-exert themselves . . . which is pure sarcasm.	Be careful, gramps! Your wheel might be loose! By using this group's action, you can decrease the Power of any one Conservative group by 3, or increase the Power of any one Liberal group by 3. This effect lasts until the beginning of your next turn.
