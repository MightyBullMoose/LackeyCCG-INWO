(Note that the plots consist of all the +10 cards, the Paralyze cards, the power
increase cards, and the alignment changers. Also note lack of Goals and NWOs.)

Special Rules: Players may play any Illuminati except Bavaria. Secret has no
special status. Choose your Illuminati *after* seeing your initial plots and
groups.

Recommended Illuminati: Cthulhu, Zurich, Network, Bermuda. UFOs, Discordia and
Shangri-La are playable but will be at a disadvantage because their goals are
more difficult.

Theme: Do you like to play many large groups, then win with 50 power just before
the fun starts? In this game, the fun never ends! Only four kinds of plots keeps
the game focused on the groups in play while providing support in your attacks
on
rivals.
