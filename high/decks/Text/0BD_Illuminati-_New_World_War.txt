SETUP Note: There are multiple extra NWO: World War 3 cards in the Lead Cards
deck; you should add at least 1 for each player in the game; 2 if you're feeling
frisky.
NWO: Peace in our Time should be treated as a Yellow (instead of Red) to help
counterbalance the NWO: WW3 cards.





INWO: One With Everything is a good way to introduce players to INWO without
making them think about deck construction (yet). But its all-the-cards,
all-the-time format can also be a drawback, if you keep drawing cards with very
specific targets (like The First Thing We Do, Let's Kill All the Lawyers) or
very specific requirements (like Angst) -- something that you don't normally
have to worry about in a constructed-deck game (unless you're just really bad at
making decks). This variant combines the newbie-friendliness of One With
Everything and the harmony of a constructed deck. The Abuses section of the One
With Everything rules alludes to this type of variant, but my intentions are
good . . .
The idea is simple -- get a set of Group cards with a common theme, and take out
the Plot cards that are less likely to be useful with those Groups. In this
case, the Groups deck focuses on Nations, making this the New World War as the
secret organizations fight for international political power. This will usually
be a cold war, but it can get hotter as NWO: World War Three comes and goes.

The Groups Deck
The Nations cards make up the heart of this deck. Groups that have something to
do with Nations (or just fit the international theme) provide support. The
Groups deck is made up of:
Al Amarja*
Australia*
The Big Prawn*
Bill Clinton
Boy Sprouts
Brazil
C.I.A.
Canada
Center for Disease Control
China
Earthquake Projector
England
Federal Reserve
Fidel Castro
Finland
France
Germany
Helmut Kohl**
Hidden City
The Holy Grail
International Cocaine Smugglers
International Communist Conspiracy
International Weather Organization
Israel
Italy
Japan
Killer Satellite*
Loch Ness Monster
The Mafia
Manuel Noriega
Margaret Thatcher
MI-5
Midas Mill
Multinational Oil Companies
NATO
Offshore Banks
Orbital Mind Control Lasers
Power Satellite*
Red Cross
Rogue Boomer
Russia
Saddam Hussein
Spy Satellite*
Switzerland
United Nations
USA**
Vatican City
Vladimir Zhirinovsky*
W.I.T.C.H.
Weather Satellite

* From the Assassins! expansion (leave them out if you don't have them -- or
substitute some other cards, like Nuclear Power Companies or Robot Sea
Monsters).

** From Neue Weltordnung (if you don't have those cards, you can find out what
they do in the article "INWO Spricht Deutsch" from Pyramid #16 and use proxies,
or just leave them out).

The Plots Deck
The Plots Deck should start with one of every Plots card you can find, at least
from the base set and the Assassins! expansion. Treat NWO: Peace in Our Time as
a Yellow NWO card for this game, to provide some counterbalance to NWO: World
War Three.
If you have INWO SubGenius, you might consider adding a few cards from there as
well, although most of them only work well with the SubGenius groups (some good
ones are Miraculous Manifestation, Rant!, The 13th Apostle, Time Control, and
Official, Divine, All-Inclusive Excuse).

Then you remove the following cards, since they don't have enough "targets" in
the Groups Deck to be useful:

Air Magic
Albino Alligators
And STAY Dead!
Angst
The Auditor from Hell
Backfire*
Backmasquerade*
Bait and Switch*
Bank Merger
Bar Codes*
The Big Score

Finally, you can use some of those blank cards to serve as duplicates of the
NWO: World War Three card, so that you have one in the deck for each player. Or
two per player if you're feeling particularly anti-social. Some of the other
blank cards can become:


War-Crimes Trials
But he started it!
Only playable when NWO: World War Three is in play. Discard NWO: World War
Three. The player who played that card must remove all action tokens from his
Nations and expose the Plot cards in his hand.



Isolationism
The target Illuminati cannot take over Nation groups.
An Illuminati action is required to play this Zap.
Play on a rival Illuminati at any time except during a privileged attack. A Zap
stays on its victim until it is removed. Spending an Illuminati action, at any
time, will remove all Zaps from any one player.


Summit
No Nation group, no matter who owns it, may use its Action token(s) until the
end of the present turn, except to defend itself against an attack.
Alternatively, if this card is played immediately after a Nation action, that
action is canceled.
This card requires an Illuminati or Nation action.


Foreign Aid
Don't spend it all in one place.
Place an Action token on any one Nation group, or on two or more Nations whose
current Power adds up to 5 or less. This card may not benefit a group that
already has any tokens, or a group which is suffering from any effect that
prevents it from getting Action tokens. This card may be played at any time. It
requires an action from your Illuminati.



Nuclear Capability
We've had Top Men working around the clock . . .
This card may be played at any time, and counts as the action for the group it
affects. The increased Power takes effect immediately. The Power for one Nation
group is increased to 6. Link this card to your chosen Nation.
No player may have more than one Nuclear Capability in play.


More Grist for the Mill
That's it -- you're set for a lively game of global thermonuclear war, just like
in WarGames. Or you can try it the sophisticated way and win through diplomatic
means. Note also that the various Illuminati are not created equal here -- the
Adepts, for instance, are not going to find a whole lot of use for their special
powers. So make sure everyone knows (or can look through) the decks before
selecting their faction.
This is just one example of a themed One With (Not Quite) Everything deck. You
could also have Illuminati: New World Paparazzi (Media and Personalities),
Illuminati: New-World Politics (U.S. Democrats and Republicans), or Illuminati:
Technomancer Order (Science and Magic). If you're into cooperative gaming, throw
in just the Peaceful Groups and let everyone play Shangri-La . . . Just so long
as you can keep dragging new players into the grip of the conspiracy, They'll be
happy.
