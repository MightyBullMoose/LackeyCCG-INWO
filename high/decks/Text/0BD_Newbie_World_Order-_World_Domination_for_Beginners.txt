Newbie World Order: World Domination for Beginners
by Glen Barnett


This is designed as a OBD for beginning players, and with ease of putting it
together in mind. You can make it with only a Factory set and a SubGenius set.
It has no Specials (in case you don't have a factory set). All cards should be
playable pretty much as written.

I have cheerfully stolen some thoughts of Ralph's in getting this all together.

It has no Disasters, no Assassinations, no Resources, and no cards to deal with
these. There are initially no Goals.

As in SubGenius, there are no Privileged attacks, and there are no special rules
for Secret groups (Secret doesn't "do" anything gamewise, unless another card
says so).

Some cards with complicated or non-obvious rulings/FAQ entries have been
omitted.

There are several lists at the end with suggested cards if you want to add
Goals, Resources, Privileged Attacks, Assassinations and Disasters, etc. You may
want to add some of these when the players get the hang of the basic game.

Currently, Bavarian Illuminati, Adepts of Hermes, Shangri-La and UFO's are not
really viable as Illuminati. If you add in Resources (see the lists at the end),
the Adepts come back in, if you add in Privileged attacks, Bavaria comes in, and
if you add in the Goals, it makes sense to include the UFO's (even though their
goal is relatively useless, it is too confusing to have them in if there are no
goals.

There are currently 60 groups and 90 plots. Every card that is here I included
for some reason - some come in on several criteria. There are 59 cards from the
SubGenius set - quite a large proportion, because they have many cards that play
with the uncontrolled area, and plots with costs well suited to OBD games. There
are 50 cards in the lists of suggested extra cards that could be added. (With
the extra cards added, this deck seemed to work very nicely in playtest. I
haven't yet had a chance to try it with only the main 150 cards.)

Possible Illuminati: Bermuda Triangle, Discordian Society, Gnomes of Zurich, The
Network, Servants of Cthulhu, Church of the SubGenius.

One other card I'd consider is March on Washington. It isn't quite playable as
written, but I think it is such a useful power that it should be at least
considered for inclusion in a set like
this.
