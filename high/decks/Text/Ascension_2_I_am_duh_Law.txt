Strategy

You're in a game with 3 Cthulhu players. Attacking to destroy against them has a
+9 bonus. That should leave plenty of opportunities for destruction. It will
also make your own groups a big fat target. Don't ignore diplomacy - 2 against 1
is a bad situation. If the UFO player is in the game, you can probably get him
to help you - for a price.

Your plot deck is pretty self explanatory.
Deprogrammers and Local Police Departments both give some nice bonuses on "any
attempt to destroy". F.B.I.'s bonus for direct attacks to destroy criminal
groups will also come in handy. Carefully consider when you bring it into play,
as your rivals will no doubt be out to get it. Remember that Local Police
Departments can not be destroyed. They may be a good lead, even if they only
have a power of 1. Fast Food Chains gives +6 to any attempt to destroy green
groups, but look out, because those same green groups have a +4 bonus to destroy
the Tobacco Companies.

Fast Food Chains and Tobacco Companies as puppets of the Pentagon will generate
a lot of free plots, but it's also a disaster magnet. International Weather
Organisation might help you keep it alive. When the attack does come, and it
will, Soulburner will punish whoever did the ignoble
deed.
