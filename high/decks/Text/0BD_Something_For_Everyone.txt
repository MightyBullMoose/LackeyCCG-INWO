Something For Everyone
by Steve Brinich


OK, here's another attempt at creating a useful tool for brainwashing, er,
recruiting INWO players.

Theme
This is a One Moderate-Sized Deck desinged to be balanced for any of the
Illuminati.

This deck is designed for play using INWO SubGenius rules.

Card Selection Notes
This deck can be built out of one INWO OWE set plus one SubGenius set. Groups
are selected to include a wide cross-section of alignments (ranging from 8
Fanatic groups to 11.5 Liberal groups) and attributes, particularly the
attributes relevant to specific Illuminati (Computer, Secret, and SubGenius).

Plots are selected to include all the available +10s, all the available
alignment-changers, and a cross-section of other useful Plots. For simplicity,
Assassinations and Disasters have been omitted.

Illuminati
Adepts of Hermes
This deck has 5 Magic Resources and 5 Magic Groups.

Under SubGenius rules, there are normally no Group hands. In order to use their
special ability, the Adepts are an exception -- they have a Group hand, and if
they attempt to take over a Group from their hand and fail, the Group returns to
their hand. (If they fail to take over a Group from the uncontrolled area, it
remains in the uncontrolled area, as usual.)

To prevent this Group hand from becoming unwieldy, and to limit the Adepts'
ability to keep certain Groups out of circulation, this Group hand is limited to
5 cards, just like the Plot hand. The Adepts may have more than 5 Group cards in
hand during their turn, but if they exceed this limit when it is not their turn
they must immediately place the excess Group cards into the uncontrolled area
(they may *not* discard them).

Bavarian Illumianti
This deck includes plenty of heavy hitters (13 Groups with printed Power 5 or
better). OTOH, you'll have to fight for them (especially the ones that count
double for somebody else), and many of them are Straight or Government (and so
cannot be used against Discordia). Your privileged attack ability is powerful,
but can be overcome by Deep Agent, Frog God, Interference, or The Moonies.

Bermuda Triangle
This deck includes a good mix of alignments (the rarest, Fanatic, appears 8
times) and moderate-to-high power Groups.

Church of the Subgenius
This deck includes 6 SubGenius Groups. The SubGenius ability to accumulate Slack
(Illuminati actions) and count up to three Slack as Groups is useful, but watch
out for . . . Or Kill Me!

Discordian Society
This deck includes 11 Weird Groups (3 of them count double for you). You are
immune to most (but not all) of the powerful Groups in this deck. Watch out for
Gordo Remora and the Good Sex For Mutants Dating League.

If the high-power Weird Groups don't come out, you'll need the right Plots
(Attitude Mutation, Jake Day, The Weird Turn Pro) or The Gay Activists (there
are many powerful Straight groups in this deck -- but The Gay Activists will be
targeted about as intensely as the I.R.S. or Nuclear Power Companies).

Gnomes of Zurich
This deck includes 10 Corporate Groups and 5 Banks (7 of them count double for
you). OTOH, there are many powerful Government groups that can destroy your
Corporate Groups, and the CFL-AIO in enemy hands can ruin your whole day.

The Network
This deck includes 8 Computer groups (5 of them count double for you). Drawing
two Plot cards per turn is especially useful in a One Big Deck game. OTOH,
you're likely to be in trouble if somebody else gets Japan or the Phone Phreaks.

Servants of Cthulhu
This deck includes a wide range of Groups with assorted bonuses to destroy
things. The Men In Black and Advanced... Nazi Hell Creatures... are the most
generally useful, but try to get a variety of other more specialized ones as
well.

Shangri-La
This deck includes 9 Peaceful Groups with 24 total Power. Shangri-La's special
goal is reduced to 20 Peaceful Power in play (i.e. in somebody's Power
Structure), which will probably require hanging on until most of the Groups deck
is played, drawing the right Plots (Attitude Mutation, Nobel Peace Prize, or
Kinder and Gentler), or getting The Gay Activists (*keeping* them, even with
your defensive bonus, is another matter). Alternatively, you can simply turtle,
take your groups where you can get them, and go for a regular victory.

Society of Assassins
This deck includes 5 Secret Groups and 8 Fanatic groups. The Fanatic groups are
mostly weak, but the Libertarians and Moral Minority have the potential to
become quite powerful.

Note that Secrecy does not have its usual effects under SubGenius rules â€“ it
only matters in determining which groups count double for the SoA and for
special abilities that mention Secret groups (e.g. Junk Mail).

UFOs
This deck doesn't use Goal cards. Instead, the UFOs secretly select the Goal of
one other Illuminati, and reveal it when they declare victory. If the victory
attempt fails, the Goal remains in effect (though now everybody knows what it
is).
