Control The World With Things Found Around the Home!
by Ralph Melton
I thought that the submissions from Glen Barnett and Aaron Curtis might satisfy
my desires, but I didn't see exactly what I want.

My idea for a OBD deck is this: I want something to use to suck in newbies.

Therefore, I want the rules to be simple. To that end, I eliminated any cards
that dealt with these topics:

Instant attacks (including Devastation and Relief)
Privileged Attacks
Resources
Exposed Plots
Goals
Duplicate Groups (and there are no duplicate groups)
I also eliminated cards that require knowing the cards well, such as the
Rosicrucians and Crop Circles.

Since this is to be played by SubGenius rules, I also eliminated anything that
dealt with discarding off of decks, or with using groups in hand. As in
SubGenius, there are no special rules for Secret groups.

Some cards need reinterpretation: interpret the Clone Arrangers' 'may restore to
life any just-killed Personality' as 'any just-destroyed Personality.' The
Fraternal Orders' Group draw should be added to the uncontrolled area.

I also want this to be a deck that I can build with cards that I wouldn't
otherwise use.

Since I've bought a few booster boxes in my time, I have a few boxes of Commons
and Uncommons that I don't really need, for which I tell my friends that they
can have any cards they want from those boxes. I raided those boxes to build
this deck. (And I don't have nearly the collection of many other people; plenty
of others could do the same.)

This means no SubGenius cards, because I don't have a spare SubGenius set. It
also means no Rare cards, because those have some slight trading value (and no
specials or German cards, by the same token.) It also means no Plot-cancellers,
because I'm woefully short on Plot-cancellers right now. It has a Bribery, but
it doesn't have a Murphy's Law, because I didn't have a spare.

In short, this is a deck built from my leftovers. I'm going to take it to
AndCon, to try to playtest it and use it to lure people into playing INWO--and
then I'm going to give it away to some likely candidate, because I can.

Illuminati: Bavaria, Adepts, and UFOs use concepts that aren't otherwise present
in the set, so should not be used. Shangri-La and the Discordian Society might
have it weak, but I put in extras of things like Kinder and Gentler, to try to
help them out. I would expect The Network, The Servants of Cthulhu, and The
Gnomes of Zurich to be strong Illuminati, and The Bermuda Triangle, The
Discordian Society, The Church of the SubGenius, and The Society of Assassins to
be conceivably viable.
