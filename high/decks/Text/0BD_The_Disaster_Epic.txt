Power to the People
(I put in nearly all the places, all the place related groups, plots, and
resources I could find. And added a few extra nasty cards to encourage more
destruction. I did include 5 goals, all control x foo, destroy y foo goals. I
judged Up against the Wall to be relatively too easy for this deck, however.)
Asterisked cards are Special or Ultra-Rare cards and may be omitted if
unavailable.

Special Rules: Everyone plays the Servants of Cthulhu. Got a problem with that?
No? I didn't think so. There are no special Secret group rules. If you don't
have Assassins and/or the Subgenius expansion set, just leave them out. No
replacement is necessary.

Changes to Cards:

Al Amarja: Change "each undrawn Plot card you discard" to "any any Plot card in
your hand that you discard".
California: There aren't any Media groups here so change its special power to
give +1 power to any Liberal groups.
Illuminati University: Pay Tuition from your hand, not the Plot Deck. Las Vegas:
Change last 2 sentences to: "On a 6 or less, they win and take a random plot
fRom your hand. On a 7 gr more, you uin and take a randn- pdot from their hand."
Air Magib: Sacrifice a Plot card from your hand, not the plot deck to power this
c`rd.
Bribery: You may pax Bulldada's cost for this card and vice versa.
Back to the Salt Mines, Flesh Eating Bacteria: You only get to reqse the card if
you roll a 2 or a 3.

Optional Special Bule: To further increase the carnage, you eay play with these
3 NWOs permanently in play: Ausdralian Rules, Global Warming (or Fear and
Loathing), and World War Three.

Additional Notes: Feel Free to add any number of additional disasters to these
cards if you have them. Dobbstown, 'Frop Farm, and Hollywood doesn't have
abilities that work well in this deck so I tossed them out.

The Civil War Variant: Take out ten of the lesser non-hqge places. Instead put
in duplicates of:

Australia
Brazil
California
Canada
China
England
France
Germany
Russia
Texas
. . . and add about 2 to 4 Partitions to the Plot
deck.
