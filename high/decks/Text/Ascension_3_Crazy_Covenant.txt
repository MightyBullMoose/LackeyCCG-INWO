3. Crazy Covenant

The ascension is near. You are a faithful servant of Cthulhu, and you and your
followers have spent years dabbling in evil magics and random violence. In
short, you've been serving the master like it was intended. Now, the stars are
right! Great Cthulhu will reveal himself, and those who are found worthy shall
get their reward.

Strategy

You're in a game with 3 Cthulhu players. Attacking to destroy against them has a
+9 bonus. That should leave plenty of opportunities for destruction. It will
also make your own groups a big fat target. Don't ignore diplomacy - 2 against 1
is a bad situation. If the UFO player is in the game, you can probably get him
to help you - for a price.

Your plot deck is pretty self explanatory.
Semiconscious Liberation Army and Ninjas add up to a +5 bonus on any attempt to
destroy. Thats a grand total of +14 on each token when attacking your Cthulhoid
rivals! Ninjas actually make a pretty good lead, since there is a -10 penalty to
destroy them. On the other hand, if you wait, you might be able to put them on
the table and push them to power 12 in one fell swoop.

Giving power 12 to the ninjas will also allow them to make some nasty instant
attacks with some plots. Just remember that the Necronomicon can backfire, so
keep a token ,(or 2 with Book of Kells), on W.I.T.C.H. for such an occasion.
You've got some potential for seppuku in this deck. Just remember that if you
fail, your rivals will be more than happy to finish the job for you. Ark of the
Covenant is a great deterrent, but it is also well suited for seppuku. The
second ingredient in a seppuku play is the Ninjas/Gun Lobby combo. Any group of
yours can attack the Ninjas, giving the ninjas a new token, while Gun Lobby
gives you a plot card.
But as mentioned, seppuku is risky, and the Ninjas/Gun Lobby combo is also good
for other strategies.

Finally, Society for Creative Anarchism is a monster against your straight
rival. Furthermore, their group discard ability is also very nasty in a game
with tight decks, like this
one.
