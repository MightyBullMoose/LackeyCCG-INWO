INWO Deck: The PC Brigade

This deck was built with a few purposes:

    To use Assassins cards that I rarely use
    To build a UFOs deck that could plausibly win with three different goals. 

It's reasonably successful at those goals. It also works well in a two-player
game.

Note that this deck is a few cards short of 45--I raided it for cards a few
times before dismantling it.

    Goal: Hail Eris
    Goal: Power For Its Own Sake
    Goal: Power to the People
    NWO: Fear and Loathing
    NWO: Military-Industrial Complex
    NWO: Political Correctness x3 

The key group of this deck is France, which can defend any of the other groups
for free. You want to boost France's power as much as possible. With Emergency
Powers or Self-Esteem, the Big Prawn, a Power Satellite, and Political
Correctness, France has a power of 17 that can defend any of your liberal groups
for free.

Even though France is the key group, you might not want to use it as your lead
puppet. I usually use the Democrats as my lead.

NWO: Political Correctness is by far the favorite NWO of this deck. It adds +3
to the power of each of your Liberal groups, which is mighty handy. Political
Correctness makes it easy to win with Power For Its Own Sake.

Ways to win: Power For Its Own Sake is fairly straightforward. For Power to the
People, either destroy other players' Conservative groups, or ATO the Fred Birch
Society and destroy them. To win with Hail Eris, use the Big Prawn to turn
France Weird, after which it will count double with California and the Swingers.
